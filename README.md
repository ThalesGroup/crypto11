# Crypto11

<!-- Badges: every one is drawn by shields.io with style=flat-square, so they share a height, a
     typeface and a corner radius. GitHub's own actions/workflows/*/badge.svg, pkg.go.dev's badge
     and api.scorecard.dev's badge each render at their own metrics and take no style parameter,
     which is why the shields.io equivalents are used instead. The two rows are deliberate: what
     the project is, then whether it is healthy. The default branch here is master, so the
     workflows that gate pushes and pull requests are pinned with branch=master; fuzz.yml runs on
     a schedule and release.yml on v* tags, so neither takes a branch. Every URL in this file is
     an absolute eclipse-keypont one on purpose, so a fork's README keeps pointing at upstream. -->

This is an implementation of the standard Golang crypto interfaces that
uses [PKCS#11](http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/errata01/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-errata01-os-complete.html)
as a backend.

Low-level PKCS#11 (Cryptoki) bindings, including the PKCS#11 v3.2 mechanisms needed for
post-quantum algorithms such as ML-KEM, are provided by
[github.com/eclipse-keypont/pkcs11-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eclipse-keypont/pkcs11-go).
crypto11 builds the familiar `crypto.Signer` / `crypto.Decrypter` Go interfaces on top of it.

**v2** is a breaking release: the PKCS#11 binding moved to
[pkcs11-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/eclipse-keypont/pkcs11-go), bringing PKCS#11 v3.2 and post-quantum
ML-KEM key support, alongside a full lint/vet cleanup and a security-hardening pass. See
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of what changed between v1 and v2, or
[Releases](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/releases) for the full commit-level history.

This repository is built with a hardened GitHub Actions pipeline: golangci-lint, govulncheck, CodeQL, secret
scanning, dependency review, and an OpenSSF Scorecard rating gate every push, and tagged releases ship a signed,
SLSA3-attested source archive plus a signed [CycloneDX SBOM](#software-bill-of-materials) rather than just being
pushed — see [Verifying release artifacts](#verifying-release-artifacts) below for what ships and how to check it.

# Part of Eclipse Keypont

crypto11 is part of [Eclipse Keypont](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.keypont), alongside
[gose](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/gose) and [pkcs11-go](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/pkcs11-go).
*Keypont* — "key" plus the French *pont* ("bridge") — reflects the project's goal: bridging Go
applications to cryptographic keys held in HSMs and other PKCS#11-backed hardware.

ML-KEM uses the `MLKEMEncapsulator` / `MLKEMDecapsulator` interfaces (not `crypto.Signer`).
Requires a PKCS#11 v3.2-capable token such as [SoftHSMv3](https://github.com/pqctoday-org/pqctoday-hsm).

Signing is done through the
[crypto.Signer](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/#Signer) interface and
decryption through
[crypto.Decrypter](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/#Decrypter).

See [the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/v2) for details of various limitations,
especially regarding symmetric crypto.


# Installation

crypto11 requires Go 1.25 or later (see the `go` directive in `go.mod`). Install the library by running:

> **Note on Go version policy**
>
> crypto11 is a library. Bumping the `go` directive in `go.mod` raises the **minimum** Go version required by every project that imports it, which can break consumers still on older toolchains.
>
> To avoid this, we follow a two-directive pattern:
> - `go X.Y.0` — the **minimum** Go version consumers need (kept conservative).
> - `toolchain go X.Y.Z` — the **recommended** toolchain used by maintainers (tracks the latest patch release).
>
> This lets projects on older Go versions still import crypto11, while maintainers can develop and test with the latest toolchain.
> See [#137](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/issues/137) for context.

```sh
go get github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/v2
```

The crypto11 library needs to be configured with information about your PKCS#11 installation. This is either done
programmatically
(see the `Config` struct in [the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/v2)) or via a
configuration
file. The configuration file is a JSON representation of the `Config` struct.

A minimal configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "Path": "/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so",
  "TokenLabel": "token1",
  "Pin": "password"
}
```

- `Path` points to the library from your PKCS#11 vendor.
- `TokenLabel` is the `CKA_LABEL` of the token you wish to use.
- `Pin` is the password for the `CKU_USER` user.
- `UseGCMIVFromHSM` generates the IV for GCM mechanism from the HSM

# Build

This package is using CGo for cryptographic packages.  
Enable CGo before building Crypto11 :

```sh
go env -w CGO_ENABLED=1
go build
```

A `Makefile` wraps the common developer commands:

| Target                       | Description                                                                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make build`                 | `go build ./...`                                                                          |
| `make test`                  | `go test ./...` (see [Testing Guidance](#testing-guidance) below for HSM-backed coverage) |
| `make lint`                  | Runs `golangci-lint` (v2) against `.golangci.yml`, same checks as CI                      |
| `make lint-fix`              | Runs `golangci-lint` with `--fix` for mechanically-fixable findings                       |
| `make notices`               | Regenerates [`NOTICES.md`](./NOTICES.md) via `go-licenses`                                |
| `make version`               | Prints the most recent git tag                                                            |
| `make release VERSION=x.y.z` | Creates a signed `vx.y.z` tag and pushes it, triggering the release workflow              |

# Testing Guidance

## Disabling tests

To disable specific tests, set the environment variable `CRYPTO11_SKIP=<flags>` where `<flags>` is a comma-separated
list of the following options:

* `CERTS` - disables certificate-related tests. Needed for AWS CloudHSM, which doesn't support certificates.
* `OAEP_LABEL` - disables RSA OAEP encryption tests that use source data encoding parameter (also known as a 'label'
  in some crypto libraries). Needed for AWS CloudHSM.
* `DSA` - disables DSA tests. Needed for AWS CloudHSM (and any other tokens not supporting DSA).

## Test configuration

The test suite never reads a tracked file. Configuration is resolved in three layers, each
overriding the one before:

1. **compiled-in defaults** — `TokenLabel: "crypto11-test"`, `Pin: "1234"`, and *no* module path
2. **a git-ignored JSON file** — `crypto11.config.json.local`, then `crypto11.config.json`, or
   whatever `CRYPTO11_CONFIG_FILE` points at
3. **environment variables**

Two families, by design: **`PKCS11_*` says which token to talk to** (each maps onto a `Config`
field), **`CRYPTO11_*` controls how the test harness behaves**.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PKCS11_MODULE` | absolute path to the PKCS#11 `.so`; `~` and `$VARS` are expanded |
| `PKCS11_PIN` | `CKU_USER` PIN |
| `PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL` | `CKA_LABEL` of the token |
| `PKCS11_TOKEN_SERIAL` | select by serial instead of label |
| `PKCS11_SLOT` | select by slot number instead of label |
| `CRYPTO11_CONFIG_FILE` | override which local file is read |
| `CRYPTO11_PROVISION` | set to `0` to never create ephemeral tokens (see below) |
| `CRYPTO11_SKIP` | per-feature skip flags for tokens that misreport support |

Environment last is deliberate: CI configures a run without writing anything into the working
tree, and your local file never has to be edited to match a runner.

To get started, copy one of the templates — both copies are git-ignored:

```sh
cp .env.template .env                     # environment variables
$EDITOR .env                              # set PKCS11_MODULE
```

or, if you prefer a config file:

```sh
cp crypto11.config.json.template crypto11.config.json.local
$EDITOR crypto11.config.json.local        # set "Path" to your module
```

`.env` is not read automatically — `go test` does not source it. Load it yourself:

```sh
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
go test ./...
```

or point your editor at it (in VS Code, `"go.testEnvFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"`).

**Put literal values in `.env`, not shell expressions.** Sourcing it in a shell expands `$HOME`,
but a dotenv loader — VS Code's `go.testEnvFile` among them — reads the file as plain `key=value`
and hands over `$HOME/...` with the `$` still in it. The harness expands `$VARS` and a leading `~`
as a safety net, but a literal path is what works under every loader. `.env` is git-ignored, so
there is nothing to leak by being explicit.

The module path must be **absolute**. A relative path would let the dynamic linker resolve it
against `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or the working directory, and a PKCS#11 module is arbitrary native code
that runs the moment it is loaded — so a relative path is rejected rather than resolved.

`PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL`, `PKCS11_TOKEN_SERIAL` and `PKCS11_SLOT` are mutually exclusive —
PKCS#11 accepts exactly one way to select a token, so setting one clears the other two.

With no module configured anywhere, `go test ./...` narrows to the fuzz targets and passes; a
clean clone needs no setup to be green.

### Ephemeral tokens, and when not to create them

When `PKCS11_MODULE` is set, `TestMain` provisions three throwaway tokens in a temp directory and
points the suite at them, so a SoftHSM run is turnkey. Provisioning calls `C_InitToken`.
`SOFTHSM2_CONF` confines SoftHSM to that temp directory, but a module that ignores it — AWS
CloudHSM, nCipher nShield, a TPM — **would be initialised in place**.

So when you point `PKCS11_MODULE` at anything that is not a throwaway SoftHSM, turn provisioning
off and select the token you already have:

```sh
CRYPTO11_PROVISION=0 PKCS11_MODULE=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so \
  PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL=my-token go test ./...
```

> **Never commit a module path or a PIN.** `crypto11.config.json`, `crypto11.config.json.local`
> and any other `*.local` file are git-ignored. Only `crypto11.config.json.template`, which
> contains placeholders, is tracked.

## Testing with SoftHSMv3 (recommended)

[SoftHSMv3](https://github.com/pqctoday-org/pqctoday-hsm) supports PKCS#11 v3.2 and is required for
ML-KEM and other post-quantum tests. Token provisioning is fully automated:

```sh
PKCS11_MODULE=/path/to/libsofthsmv3.so go test ./...
```

Override the user PIN (default `1234`):

```sh
PKCS11_MODULE=/path/to/libsofthsmv3.so PKCS11_PIN=mypin go test ./...
```

`TestMain` in `setup_test.go` creates three ephemeral tokens (`crypto11-test`, `token1`, `token2`)
via the PKCS#11 API, exports the `CRYPTO11_*` variables that point at them, runs all tests, then
cleans up. No external tools or manual token setup are required, and **nothing is written into the
working tree** — so an interrupted run cannot leave your module path or PIN in a file git would
offer to commit.

DSA, DES3, PSS, and HMAC are not supported by SoftHSMv3 and those tests are automatically skipped.

## Unit test on one file

```sh
export DEPENDENCIES="rand.go attributes.go hmac.go crypto11.go common.go keys.go rsa.go certificates.go ecdsa.go blockmode.go sessions.go aead.go dsa.go symmetric.go mlkem.go common_test.go"
go test blockmode_test.go $DEPENDENCIES
```

Remote debug :

```sh
dlv test --headless --listen=:2345 --api-version=2 --accept-multiclient blockmode_test.go $DEPENDENCIES
```

## Testing with AWS CloudHSM

A minimal configuration file for CloudHSM will look like this:

```json
{
  "Path": "/opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11_standard.so",
  "TokenLabel": "cavium",
  "Pin": "username:password",
  "UseGCMIVFromHSM": true
}
```

To run the test suite you must skip unsupported tests:

```sh
CRYPTO11_SKIP=CERTS,OAEP_LABEL,DSA go test -v
```

Be sure to take note of the supported mechanisms, key types and other idiosyncrasies described at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/pkcs11-library.html. Here's a collection of things we
noticed when testing with the v2.0.4 PKCS#11 library:

- 1024-bit RSA keys don't appear to be supported, despite what `C_GetMechanismInfo` tells you.
- The `CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP` mechanism doesn't support source data. I.e. when constructing a `CK_RSA_PKCS_OAEP_PARAMS`,
  one must set `pSourceData` to `NULL` and `ulSourceDataLen` to zero.
- CloudHSM will generate it's own IV for GCM mode. This is described in their documentation, see footnote 4 on
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/pkcs11-mechanisms.html.
- It appears that `CKA_ID` values must be unique, otherwise you get a `CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID` error.
- Very rapid session opening can trigger the following error:
  ```text
  C_OpenSession failed with error CKR_ARGUMENTS_BAD : 0x00000007
  HSM error 8c: HSM Error: Already maximum number of sessions are issued
  ```

## Testing with SoftHSM2

[SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/softhsm/SoftHSMv2) covers all classical algorithms but does **not**
support ML-KEM or other PKCS#11 v3.2 mechanisms (those tests will be skipped automatically via
`skipIfMechUnsupported`).

To set up a slot:

```sh
$ cat softhsm2.conf
directories.tokendir = /path/to/crypto11/tokens
objectstore.backend = file
log.level = INFO
$ mkdir tokens
$ export SOFTHSM2_CONF=`pwd`/softhsm2.conf
$ softhsm2-util --init-token --slot 0 --label test
=== SO PIN (4-255 characters) ===
Please enter SO PIN: ********
Please reenter SO PIN: ********
=== User PIN (4-255 characters) ===
Please enter user PIN: ********
Please reenter user PIN: ********
The token has been initialized.
```

The configuration goes in `crypto11.config.json.local` (git-ignored — see
[Test configuration](#test-configuration)):

```json
{
  "Path": "/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so",
  "TokenLabel": "test",
  "Pin": "password"
}
```

or, equivalently, with no file at all:

```sh
PKCS11_MODULE=/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL=test CRYPTO11_PROVISION=0 go test ./...
```

OAEP is only partial and HMAC is unsupported on SoftHSMv2, so expect test skips.

## Testing with nCipher nShield

In all cases, it's worth enabling nShield PKCS#11 log output:

```sh
export CKNFAST_DEBUG=2
```

To protect keys with a 1/N operator cardset:

```json
{
  "Path" : "/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so",
  "TokenLabel": "rjk",
  "Pin" : "password"
}
```

You can also identify the token by serial number, which in this case
means the first 16 hex digits of the operator cardset's token hash:

```json
{
  "Path" : "/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so",
  "TokenSerial": "1d42780caa22efd5",
  "Pin" : "password"
}
```

A card from the cardset must be in the slot when you run `go test`.

To protect keys with the module only, use the 'accelerator' token:

```json
{
  "Path" : "/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so",
  "TokenLabel": "accelerator",
  "Pin" : "password"
}
```

(At time of writing) GCM is not implemented, so expect test skips.

## Testing with a TPM and PKCS11

You must know that tpm2-pkcs11 is much more limited than other libraries like softhsm2 for cryptographic operations.  
The absence of the `C_GenerateKey` function in the tpm2-pkcs11 library is one example of the limitations.  
However, some of the tests have been modified to support the tpm2-pkcs11 library's specificities.

To test with a TPM, you need to :

- install a virtual TPM or use a TPM on your machine
- install the `libtpm2_pkcs11` library
- create all the keys you need for the unit tests in the TPM (since C_Generate key is not supported)

Configure :

```json
{
  "Path": "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtpm2_pkcs11.so.1",
  "TokenLabel": "mylabel",
  "Pin": "mypin"
}
```

Fine tune the unit tests to use the keys you created in the previous step.  
Beware that a lot of unit tests may fail otherwise. You must fine-tune your usecase for a TPM usage.

# Limitations

* The [PKCS1v15DecryptOptions SessionKeyLen](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa/#PKCS1v15DecryptOptions) field
  is not implemented and an error is returned if it is nonzero.
  The reason for this is that it is not possible for crypto11 to guarantee the constant-time behavior in the
  specification.
  See [issue #5](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/issues/5) for further discussion.
* Symmetric crypto support via [cipher.Block](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/#Block) is very slow.
  You can use the `BlockModeCloser` API
  (over 400 times as fast on my computer)
  but you must call the Close()
  interface (not found in [cipher.BlockMode](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/#BlockMode)).
  See [issue #6](https://github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/issues/6) for further discussion.
* Unit tests may interfere between them. You should fine tune and select the Go test file you want to run, one at a
  time.

# Verifying release artifacts

Each GitHub Release ships a deterministic source archive plus everything needed to verify it without trusting
GitHub. For a release `vX.Y.Z` you'll find:

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` | The source archive, built with `git archive` from the tagged commit |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256` | SHA-256 checksum of the archive |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.cosign.bundle` | Keyless [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) signature (signed via GitHub Actions OIDC — no private key involved) |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json` | [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) 1.6 SBOM of the module — see [Software Bill of Materials](#software-bill-of-materials) |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json.sha256` | SHA-256 checksum of the SBOM |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json.cosign.bundle` | Keyless cosign signature of the SBOM |
| `crypto11-vX.Y.Z.intoto.jsonl` | [SLSA3](https://slsa.dev/) build provenance covering **both** the archive and the SBOM, produced by [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) |

Download all assets for the release you want to verify:

```sh
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo eclipse-keypont/crypto11
```

**1. Verify the checksums**

```sh
sha256sum -c crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz.sha256
sha256sum -c crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json.sha256
```

**2. Verify the cosign signatures** (requires [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/))

```sh
for f in crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json; do
  cosign verify-blob \
    --bundle "$f.cosign.bundle" \
    --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*$' \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
    "$f"
done
```

**3. Verify the SLSA provenance** (requires [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier))

The provenance has two subjects — the archive and the SBOM — so verify both in one call:

```sh
slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
  --provenance-path crypto11-vX.Y.Z.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/eclipse-keypont/crypto11 \
  --source-tag vX.Y.Z \
  crypto11-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json
```

**4. Verify the git tag itself** — release tags are GPG/SSH-signed by `make release` (`git tag -s`):

```sh
git verify-tag vX.Y.Z
```

`go get` consumers don't need any of this — they fetch source through the Go module proxy and verify it via
`go.sum` / `sum.golang.org`. These assets exist for auditors and to satisfy OpenSSF Scorecard's Signed-Releases
check.

# Software Bill of Materials

Every release ships a [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) 1.6 SBOM (`crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json`), generated with
[`cyclonedx-gomod`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod) and signed and attested exactly like the source
archive (see [Verifying release artifacts](#verifying-release-artifacts)). It describes:

* the `crypto11` component itself, typed as a **library**, with its module path, version and VCS reference;
* its build-time dependency graph — `pkcs11-go` and `pkg/errors` — as `pkg:golang/...` PackageURLs;
* the **Go standard library** as a component (`pkg:golang/std@goX.Y.Z`), so stdlib CVEs stay visible to SBOM
  consumers, matching what `govulncheck` covers;
* detected **licenses**, recorded as CycloneDX evidence rather than assertions (detection is heuristic).

Test-only dependencies (`testify` and friends) are deliberately excluded: they are not part of what a consumer of
the library links against, and including them produces false positives in downstream vulnerability scanners.

Regenerate the SBOM yourself with the same flags CI uses:

```sh
go install github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod/cmd/cyclonedx-gomod@v1.10.0
make sbom          # writes crypto11.cdx.json
```

The SBOM is generated with `-noserial -notimestamp`, so it is byte-reproducible from the tagged commit — checking
out `vX.Y.Z` and running `make sbom` on linux/amd64 yields the same content as the published artifact (the
`goos`/`goarch` PackageURL qualifiers make the output platform-specific).

Feed it into whatever consumes CycloneDX — for example
[Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/), [osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner)
(`osv-scanner scan source --sbom crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json`) or `grype sbom:crypto11-vX.Y.Z.cdx.json`.
